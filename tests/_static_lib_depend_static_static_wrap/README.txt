NOTE, TEST FOR FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY, NOT EXPECTED TO PASS

Static library, lib_static1, is used as a dependency by the archive in static library, lib_static0.

i.e. lib_static0 -> lib_static1

Note, we expect the archive(s) of lib_static0 to include items from lib_static1

TODO check the above is the case somehow(?)
