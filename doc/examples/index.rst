Examples
--------

This section contains examples to demonstrate some of the features of CMake XCommon. Some examples focus
on the contents of the CMakeLists.txt files to show how the API functions and variables can be used,
without presenting the full application/module source code. Others are complete "mini-applications" with
example source code.
